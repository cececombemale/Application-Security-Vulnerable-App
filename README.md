# Application-Security-Vulnerable-App

I have included weak authentication and a vulnerable dependency in this project. The user is allowed to attempt login as many times as possible, there is no password length minimum or special character requirement, and passwords are not hashed within the database. This makes it very easy for an attacker to get into the system. They can simply guess passwords as many times as they would like to brute force login and because there is no complexity requirement with regards to passwords, they are very easy to brute force. The second vulnerability lies within the fact that I used a dependency with a vulnerability. The vulnerability lies within a library I use called react-scripts, and specifically a package called minimalist within react-scripts. From the NPM official website: “ Affected versions of minimist are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects. Parsing the argument --proto.y=Polluted adds a y property with value Polluted to all objects. The argument --proto=Polluted raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.” If exploited, this could be utilized to perform a denial of service attack. A denial of service attack could potentially cause a large loss of income to a company.
